# Keras to/from MDF Converter

## Keras
Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks. It is written in Python and is used to make the implementation of neural networks easy. It also supports multiple backend neural network computation.

## Keras to MDF
To be able to create a model using Keras, train it, and then export it to MDF to use it with any MDF compatible tools:

### Step 1
Install MDF [locally.](https://mdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/Installation.html)


### Step 2
Install [Keras](https://keras.io/)

Work in progress...
